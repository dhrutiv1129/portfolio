          Throughout my roles, Iâ€™ve worn many hats. As a product manager, I defined the why and what. 
          As an engineer, I designed the how. As a researcher, I translated complex data into actionable insights. 
          As an entrepreneur, I turned ideas into tangible products. These experiences shape how I approach 
          problems through balancing strategy with execution to build solutions that are technically robust, 
          user-centered, and built to scale.
